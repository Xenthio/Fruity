An attempt to make a *real* Mac cleaner for background tasks

## This is how it's gonna work.
- Make a list of all default mac os background processes from a clean install (Not including the Apps.).
- show all processes that are not in the list for the users macos version.
- show Process stats such as cpu usage disk usage and memory usage.
- a kill process button for each task.

## Contributing
contributing in anyway (such as providing a list of processes for different version of macOS or even implementing them into the program) is greatly appreciated.
